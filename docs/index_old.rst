Welcome to spotify-manager!
===========================
*spotify-manager* is a lightweight Python3 library for the easy use and
integration of `Spotipy <https://github.com/plamere/spotipy>`_ in your projects.
As long as this library is only an upper leveled Spotipy, it still works with
the `Spotify Web API <https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/>`_ and your are
going to need Spotify Premium and an API Token.

The spirit of spotify-manager is to automatize some requests related with the
streaming, but not all of them. Searching data or updating your profile is less
important for this library than play your fifty last tracks again or repeat a
song. I just focused on the things I find more important and util.

Here's a quick example of using *spotify-manager* to search and play a track
like for example 'Mockingbird' by 'Eminem'::

    from spotify_manager import SpotifyManager

    sm = SpotifyManager(username, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
    results = sm.search_track('eminem mockingbird')
    sm.play(uris=[results['tracks'][0]['uri']])

Here's another example showing how to play songs related to the artist you
are listening to right now::

    from spotify_manager import SpotifyManager

    sm = SpotifyManager(username, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
    sm.play_current_artist_related_tracks()

Finally, here's an example of increasing the volume of the device you are
listening to right now a twenty percent::

    from spotify_manager import SpotifyManager

    sm = SpotifyManager(username, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
    sm.add_volume(20)

As you can see, it's pretty simple to use this library and it's more upper
leveled than `Spotipy <https://github.com/plamere/spotipy>`_, so you don't
have to focus that much on the implementation.

Authorized requests
===================
As long as this is a library that uses Spotify's API you are going to need
authentication to use it. How the problem are the same than with Spotipy, and
I'm using that library, the best I can do is to link their docs to allow you
to read about this problem (feature).
